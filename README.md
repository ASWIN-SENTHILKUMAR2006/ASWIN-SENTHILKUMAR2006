## About

I build web applications focused on clean, maintainable server-side code and pragmatic front-end interfaces. My primary stack is Java with Spring Boot on the backend, MySQL for persistent storage, and modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. Projects are often developed as personal learning exercises and prototypes.

## Core skills

- Java & Spring Boot — backend development, REST APIs, dependency injection, and common Spring ecosystem tools.
- MySQL — relational database design, queries, and basic optimization.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript — responsive UI, Bootstrap-based layouts, and client-side interactivity.

## Also familiar with

<small>Git · Bootstrap · Postman · PHP · Python · C</small>
